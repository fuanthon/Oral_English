                Points and Grading
                </h3>

                Breakdown of Final Grade:
                    <p style="margin-left:5%">
                        50% = Final Exam <br>
                        50% = Points <br> <br>
                        where: <br>
                        900 points = 70% <br>
                        1000 points = 80% <br>
                        1100 points = 90%<br>
                        1200 points = 100%<br>
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent justify">The grade that you can obtain from the points is a step function. This means that, for example, you must get at least 900 points to get a 70%. Then to get 80%, you must reach 1000 points, and when you have between 900 and 1000 points, your grade is not affected. </p>
