                <hr>
                Here are my answers to some frequently asked questions (faq's):

                <div class="content justify" style="margin-left: 5%">

                    <br>

                    <h4>
                    S: Teacher, how can I improve my English?</h4>
                    <p>
                        T: Well, it is very difficult for anyone to improve their English not only because of the many elements that comprise the English language, but also because of the fact that language is an ever-changing phenomena! Therefore, we should first consider what English skills we want to improve on; For example, it could be speaking or listening. But how we practice these aspects of English is also heavily affected by what our final goal is for improving that certain aspect. In order to create a suitable strategy for improving our English, I suggest we think about the following questions:
                        <br>
                        "What English skills do I want to improve on?" 
                        <br>"Why do I want to improve on these English skills?" or "What do I want to be able to do with these English skills?"</p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>TL;DR (too long; didn't read)</strong> <br>

                        English is hard and there are too many things to learn. So, identify what we want to do with English first, because what we want to do will change how we study.
                    </p>
                    <br><br>

                    <h4>
                    S: Teacher, do you have any recommended tools to use for studying English?</h4>
                    <p>
                        T: Yes! I myself use the application "Anki," which is a very helpful for memorizing all sorts of things, including vocabulary words. Anki has helped me increased my Chinese and Japanese vocabulary and I highly recommend it!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I would also recommend finding a good English book, movie, tv show, or video game to enjoy, which can help with English language immersion. It is a good way to do something you enjoy while learning English!

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>TL;DR </strong> <br>
                    Use "Anki" to memorize stuff, and read or watch some English media!
                    </p>

                    <br><br>

                    <h4>
                    S: Teacher, can you recommend me any English books, movies, video game, etc etc?</h4>
                    <p>
                        T: Preferences in regards to media are highly personal things. Therefore, it would be very difficult for me to give a list of recommendations in a FAQ's section of a website and tailor it for all my readers. For that same reason, I don't have anything that I would recommend in general, since everyone has their own preferences. If you would really like to know what I can recommend to <strong>you</strong>, come find me in person and we can talk about it! Nevertheless, here are some of my favorites:
